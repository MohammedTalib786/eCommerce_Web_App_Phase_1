>>>>> For Tausif
- Firstly You need to clone the Repo from GitHub
- After that create a new Branch 
- Then Clone the "Src" folder and Use it in your test local repo which you will create alongside this clone repo
(Which we've discussed - That you will create 2 repos 1 will be cloned one and another is your local one in which you will start the development )
- After making all the changes you will create a new folder in this Repo Called Tausif_Src in which you will paste all the components files and folders
- Then commit the changes
- After that I will Review and will merge the code
- Then We'll Deploy the site.

Repo name - Phase one _ 1  (something like this)
